    <p class='center subtitle'><span class='bold'>Shots and Goals</span></p>
    <p class='explain'>
      &emsp;This design visualizes the spatial layout of attempted shots and their conversion to goals on a regulation sized soccer goal post. Begin by selecting a team. All team data is displayed by default and can be further filtered by competition season and shot type.
    </p>
    <div class='flex-container'>
      <p class='shot-legend'>
        Each shot is denoted by a point drawn on the goalpost. <br><br>

        <span class='red'>Red</span> points denote shot attempts that ended up in goal, while <br> 
        <span class='bold'>Black</span> points denote attempts that were blocked or off-target. <br> 
        <span class='faint'>Opacity</span> denotes a shot's xG (eXpectedGoals) statistic, a popular metric used to measure the likelihood of scoring. Easier shots have high xG and appear more solid, while harder shots have lower xG and appear more transparent.
      </p>

  <!-- Passes Header -->

  <div id='shot-descript'>
    <p class='center subtitle'><span class='bold'>Passes and Assists</span></p>
    <p class='explain'>
      &emsp;These designs visualize the spatial distribution of passes and assists over the pitch. Assists in this context refer to passes right before a shot attempt, whether the attempt leads to a goal or not. The pitch is a regulation-sized 120-by-80 yard field. The selected team's direction of play is to the right.
    </p>

  <!-- Passes Visualization -->

      <p class='center' style='font-size: 12pt;'><span class='bold'>Aggregated Passes</span></p>
      <p class='descript'>
        &emsp;In any particular match, each team will make several hundred passes. In this visualization, passes are spatially aggregated over an entire season via K-Means clustering. The number of matches aggregated is noted above the pitch. Each aggregate pass represents a cluster of similar passes, and is represented by a tapered line, with start and end points corresponding to the thin and thick ends respectively. Thicker and darker lines represent more common passes. <br><br>
        
        Each cluster is also colored by how often the pass is <span class='blue'>complete</span> or <span class='red'>incomplete</span>. Use the filters to focus on passes of a certain length or passes that more or less likely to be successfully received.

      <p class='descript'>
        &emsp;An assist is commonly understood to be the last pass to the scorer of a goal. Each assist is denoted by a ring drawn on the pitch. <br><br>
        
        The pitch is divided into a 6x3 grid commonly used by coaches (see for example, <a href=https://spielverlagerung.com/glossary/pitch-zones/zone-14>Zone 14</a>) with the central strip as wide as the six yard box. Each cell of the grid represents a zone. <br><br>

        The color <span class='red'>intensity</span> of a zone represents the frequency of assists that orginated from that zone. <br><br>
